## Question 2 (CO2)  
Write a Python script that incorporates `if` statements, `for` loops, and user input to perform the following tasks:  

### Tasks  
- **Task 2.1:** Create a list `A` of `n` numbers and write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list:  
  1. Take the integer input value of `n` by the user.  
  2. Take the input of all `n` numbers by the user.  
  3. Create a function that multiplies all the numbers of the list.  

- **Task 2.2:** Write a Python function to return a new list `B` with unique elements of the list `A`.  

- **Task 2.3:** Use a lambda expression to get the square of each element of the list `B`.  

- **Task 2.4:** Fill in the `IndianRupees` class to accept color (Yellow, Gray, Magenta) of the Indian note and their values in INR (200, 500, 2000) [let 1 USD = 85 INR], and return the following statement:  
  > ‚ÄúI have a Gray colored note of Rs 500 and it is equal to 5.88 USD.‚Äù  

```python
class IndianRupees:
    colors = []
    values = []

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __str__(self):
        pass
```

## Question 3 (CO3, CO5)  
Write a Python script considering suitable examples to demonstrate the required operations. Import libraries `numpy` and `pandas`, and perform the following tasks:  

### Tasks  
- **Task 3.1:** Using NumPy:  
  1. Create a 2D array of shape (3, 4) with random integers ranging from 1 to 9.  
  2. Find the sum of all elements in the array.  
  3. Calculate the mean of each column.  
  4. Reshape the array into a shape of (4, 3).  

- **Task 3.2:** Using Pandas:  
  1. Create a DataFrame from the reshaped array. Assign column names as `A`, `B`, and `C`, and index as `W`, `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.  
  2. Create a new column `D` in the DataFrame containing each row‚Äôs sum values.  
  3. Replace all values greater than 5 with `1`, less than 5 with `0`, and keep `5` as it is.  
  4. Identify and display the columns that contain the term `5`.  

- **Task 3.3:** Write a Python script to get the line plot for the sum of values obtained in column `D` for each row. Ensure legends, labels, and title are displayed.

## Question 4 (CO4, CO5)  
Consider the following data in a CSV file named `StudentMarks.csv`:  

### Tasks  
- **Task 4.1:** Import all the required libraries.  
- **Task 4.2:** Load the dataset and show the information contained in the DataFrame (e.g., count, mean, max, etc.).  
- **Task 4.3:** Fill the missing values in marks with `0`.  
- **Task 4.4:** Create a new column for Total Marks (100) and add it to the DataFrame.  
- **Task 4.5:** Find the average marks of the class, standard deviation (up to 2 decimal places), maximum, and minimum marks obtained by the students.  
- **Task 4.6:** Create a new column for `Pass/Fail`, indicating student `Pass` if Total Marks is greater than 35; otherwise, `Fail`.  
- **Task 4.7:** Plot a count plot to show the comparison of the number of students Pass/Fail on Gender basis.  
- **Task 4.8:** Plot a pie chart to show the percentage of Pass/Fail students.
