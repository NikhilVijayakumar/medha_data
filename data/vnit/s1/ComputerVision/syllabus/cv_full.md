## Module 1: Introduction to Computer Vision

### Overview
**What is computer vision?**  
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret, analyze, and understand visual data from the world, such as images or videos.

**Advantages of Computer Vision**
- Automates tasks like object detection, facial recognition, and scene understanding.
- Enhances decision-making in robotics, healthcare, and autonomous systems.
- Reduces human error in repetitive or dangerous tasks.

**Disadvantages of Computer Vision**
- Requires high computational power for real-time processing.
- Performance is sensitive to lighting, occlusions, and image quality.
- Challenges with ambiguity and context understanding.

### General Applications
- Medical imaging (e.g., tumor detection).
- Autonomous vehicles (ADAS, self-driving cars).
- Surveillance systems and facial recognition.
- Augmented reality and robotics.
