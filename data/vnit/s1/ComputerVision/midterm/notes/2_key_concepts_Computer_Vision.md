# Key Concepts in Computer Vision and Related Fields

This notebook provides a glossary of key terms in computer vision and related areas.

## Core Computer Vision Concepts

* **Computer Vision:** An interdisciplinary field that aims to enable computers to "see" and interpret images and videos, extracting useful information from them.
* **Algorithm:** A well-defined set of instructions or rules to solve a problem or perform a computation. Computer vision algorithms are used to analyse and interpret visual data.
* **Segmentation:** The process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments or regions, often based on features like colour or texture.
* **Tracking:** In computer vision, the process of locating a moving object or feature over time in a sequence of video frames.
* **Stereo Matching:** A computer vision technique used to infer 3D information about a scene by comparing two or more images taken from different viewpoints.
* **Structure from Motion:** A computer vision technique that reconstructs the 3D structure of a scene from a set of 2D images taken from different viewpoints.

## Applications of Computer Vision

* **Face Detection:** A computer vision technology that identifies and locates human faces within digital images.
* **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** Technology that enables computers to recognize text within images, converting it into machine-readable text.
* **Machine Inspection:** The use of automated systems, often employing computer vision, to examine and assess the quality or characteristics of manufactured goods.
* **Biometrics:** The identification of humans by their characteristics or traits. Computer vision plays a role in biometric systems like fingerprint and face recognition.

## 3D Vision and Modeling

* **3D Model:** A digital representation of a three-dimensional object's surface. In computer vision, these models are often reconstructed from images.

## Related Fields

* **Computational Photography:** A field that focuses on enhancing or extending the capabilities of digital photography using computational techniques.
* **Computer Graphics:** The field of generating images from digital models. It is related to computer vision but operates in the reverse direction.

## Visual Effects and Motion

* **Match Move:** A visual effects technique used to integrate computer-generated imagery with live-action footage by tracking camera motion and object positions.
* **Motion Capture:** The process of recording movement and translating it into digital data, often used for character animation in films and games. Computer vision techniques can be used for this.

## Advanced Tasks

* **Scene Completion:** The task of filling in missing or obscured parts of an image or scene, often using information from neighbouring areas or learned patterns.
