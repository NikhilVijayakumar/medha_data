    "back_answer": "The ORDER BY clause sorts query results by one or more columns. You can choose ascending (A-Z, smallest to largest) or descending order (Z-A, largest to smallest). If multiple columns are used, it sorts first by the first column, then by the next within each group."

    "front_prompt": "Give an analogy for the LIMIT clause.",  
    "back_answer": "The LIMIT clause is like a filter that lets only a certain number of items through. For example, if you have a long list of names and only want to see the first 5, LIMIT acts as a gatekeeper letting just those 5 pass."

    "front_prompt": "Why is the ORDER BY clause usually placed after WHERE?",  
    "back_answer": "ORDER BY comes after WHERE because you first filter the data (WHERE) and then sort what’s left. It’s like cleaning your room (filtering) before arranging toys in order."

    "front_prompt": "What’s the difference between MySQL LIMIT and SQL Server TOP?",  
    "back_answer": "MySQL uses LIMIT to restrict rows, while SQL Server uses TOP. Think of LIMIT as a bucket that fills up with a certain number of items, and TOP as a label on the bucket saying ‘only fill this much’."

    "back_answer": "DISTINCT checks all selected columns together. A row is unique only if the combination of values across those columns isn’t repeated, like ensuring no duplicate pairs in a list."
