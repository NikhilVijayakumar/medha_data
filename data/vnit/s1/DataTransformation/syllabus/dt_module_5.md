# Module 5: Advanced Queries for Large Databases

## Overview
- **SQL Views**  
  - Creating, altering, renaming, and dropping views; benefits of using views.

- **Stored Procedures**  
  - Key advantages (reusability, security) and working with parameters.

- **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**  
  - Scalar, inline table-valued, and multi-statement table-valued functions.

- **Error Handling**  
  - Implementing `TRY...CATCH` blocks for robust query execution.

- **Ranking Functions**  
  - `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER` for sorting and grouping data.

- **Indexes for Performance**  
  - Clustered vs. non-clustered indexes; guidelines for efficient index creation.

- **Covering Queries**  
  - Leveraging indexes to avoid table scans in large datasets.

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**  
  - Recursive CTEs and hierarchical data querying.

- **Python as a Front End**  
  - Integration of Python with SQL for data analysis and automation.

- **NoSQL Querying**  
  - Introduction to querying NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) vs. relational models.

- **Handling Large Datasets**  
  - Optimization techniques for scalability, performance, and memory management.
