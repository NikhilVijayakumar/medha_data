## Overview
- **Relational Database Fundamentals**  
  - Tables, rows, columns, and keys as foundational concepts.

- **Operators in SQL**  
  - Logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) and relational operators (`=`, `<`, `>`, etc.).

- **Constraints and Domains**  
  - Primary key, foreign key, unique constraints; domain definitions for data validation.

- **Indexes**  
  - Types (clustered, non-clustered) and their role in query performance optimization.

- **Stored Procedures**  
  - Precompiled SQL code blocks for reusable operations.

- **Primary, Foreign, and Unique Keys**  
  - Enforcing referential integrity and uniqueness constraints.

- **Group Functions**  
  - Aggregation functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN` with `GROUP BY`.
