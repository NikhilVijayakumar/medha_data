# Module 2: Database Normalization and Entity-Relationship Model

## Overview
- **Entity-Relationship (E-R) Model**  
  - Concepts of entities, attributes, and relationships.

- **Entities and Entity Sets**  
  - Definition of entities and how they are grouped into sets.

- **Attributes and Their Types**  
  - Single-valued vs. multi-valued attributes; derived and composite attributes.

- **Relationship Sets and Degree**  
  - How entities relate to each other; one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many relationships.

- **Mapping Cardinalities**  
  - Constraints on the number of entity instances that can participate in a relationship.

- **E-R Notation Symbols**  
  - Standard symbols for representing entities, attributes, and relationships (e.g., diamonds, rectangles).

- **Database Normalization**  
  - Principles of normalization to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

- **Functional Dependencies**  
  - Key concepts underpinning normalization: candidate keys, primary keys.

- **Normalization Forms**  
  - First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), Third Normal Form (3NF),  
    Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), Fourth Normal Form (4NF), Fifth Normal Form (5NF).
