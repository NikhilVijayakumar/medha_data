Answer each question in 2-3 sentences.

1.  **Explain the concept of "projection" or "component" of one vector onto another.**
    The **projection** (or component) of a vector $\vec{v}$ onto another vector $\vec{w}$ represents the scalar component of $\vec{v}$ that lies precisely in the direction of $\vec{w}$. It quantifies how much of $\vec{v}$ is aligned with $\vec{w}$, effectively isolating the portion of one vector that acts along the direction of another.

2.  **What is the significance of removing the component of one vector from another?**
    Removing the component of $\vec{v}$ from $\vec{w}$ (or vice-versa, specifically $\vec{v}$ from the component of $\vec{w}$ in $\vec{v}$) results in a new vector that is **orthogonal** to $\vec{w}$. This process is fundamental in methods like Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, where it's used to construct orthogonal bases by iteratively making vectors perpendicular to previously established ones.

3.  **Define the "norm" of a vector. How is it calculated?**
    The **norm** of a vector represents its length or magnitude. For a vector $\vec{w}$ with components $(w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n)$, its norm, denoted as $||\vec{w}||$, is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of its components: $||\vec{w}|| = \sqrt{w_1^2 + w_2^2 + \ldots + w_n^2}$.

4.  **What does it mean for two vectors to be "unit norm" and "orthogonal" to each other?**
    Two vectors are "**unit norm**" if their length (norm) is equal to $1$. They are "**orthogonal**" if their **dot product** is zero, which means they are perpendicular to each other. When vectors are both unit norm and orthogonal, they form an **orthonormal** set, which is highly desirable for basis vectors.

5.  **What is the "Null Space ($N(A)$)" of a matrix $A$?**
    The **Null Space** of a matrix $A$, denoted as $N(A)$, is the set of all vectors $\vec{x}$ such that when multiplied by $A$, the result is the zero vector ($A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$). It is a vector space itself, meaning it is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication.

6.  **How do you test if a vector belongs to the Null Space of a matrix $A$?**
    To test if a vector $\vec{x}$ belongs to the Null Space of a matrix $A$, you simply perform the matrix-vector multiplication $A\vec{x}$. If the result is the zero vector ($\vec{0}$), then $\vec{x}$ is in the Null Space; otherwise, it is not.

7.  **What is the "Trace" of a matrix? What is one of its properties related to matrix multiplication?**
    The **Trace** of a square matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. A useful property is that for conformable matrices $A$ and $B$, the Trace of their product $AB$ is equal to the Trace of their product in reverse order $BA$, i.e., $Tr(AB) = Tr(BA)$.

8.  **Define a "Hermitian symmetric matrix".**
    A **Hermitian symmetric matrix** is a square matrix that is equal to its own **conjugate transpose** ($A = A^*$, where $A^*$ denotes the conjugate transpose). For real matrices (matrices with only real entries), this simply means the matrix is symmetric ($A = A^T$, where $A^T$ is the transpose).

9.  **What are two key properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Hermitian symmetric matrix?**
    Two key properties are: (1) **Eigenvalues** of a Hermitian symmetric matrix are always **real numbers**. (2) **Eigenvectors** corresponding to distinct eigenvalues of a Hermitian symmetric matrix are **orthogonal** to each other. These properties make them invaluable in various applications.

10. **Briefly explain "Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD)" for a Hermitian symmetric matrix.**
    **Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD)** for a Hermitian symmetric matrix $A$ expresses $A$ as the product of three matrices: a matrix $V$ (whose columns are the eigenvectors), a diagonal matrix $\Lambda$ (whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues), and the conjugate transpose of $V$ ($V^*$). It is represented as $A = V\Lambda V^*$.

## Essay Questions

1.  **Discuss the process of finding the projection of one vector onto another and explain its application in linear algebra, particularly in the context of creating orthogonal vectors.**
    The **projection** of a vector $\vec{v}$ onto another non-zero vector $\vec{w}$ is the component of $\vec{v}$ that lies in the direction of $\vec{w}$. It quantifies how much of $\vec{v}$ aligns with $\vec{w}$. The scalar projection is given by $\frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w}}{||\vec{w}||}$, which is the length of the projected vector. The vector projection is found by multiplying this scalar projection by the unit vector in the direction of $\vec{w}$, resulting in $\text{proj}_{\vec{w}}\vec{v} = \frac{(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w})}{||\vec{w}||^2} \vec{w}$. A key application in linear algebra is in creating **orthogonal vectors**. By subtracting the projection of $\vec{v}$ onto $\vec{w}$ from $\vec{v}$ itself, we obtain a new vector $\vec{v}' = \vec{v} - \text{proj}_{\vec{w}}\vec{v}$. This new vector $\vec{v}'$ is guaranteed to be orthogonal to $\vec{w}$. This process is the core idea behind the **Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process**, which systematically transforms a set of linearly independent vectors into an orthonormal basis for a vector space, by making each successive vector orthogonal to all preceding ones.

2.  **Elaborate on the concept of the Null Space of a matrix. How is it found, and what does it represent geometrically and algebraically? Provide an example of how a basis for the Null Space can be determined.**
    The **Null Space** of a matrix $A$, denoted as $N(A)$ or $\text{ker}(A)$ (kernel of A), is the set of all vectors $\vec{x}$ that are mapped to the zero vector when multiplied by $A$. Algebraically, it's the solution set to the homogeneous linear system $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$. Geometrically, the Null Space represents a subspace within the domain of the linear transformation defined by $A$. It consists of all vectors that are "annihilated" or "collapsed" to the origin by the transformation. To find the Null Space, one typically performs **row reduction** (Gaussian elimination) on the augmented matrix $[A | \vec{0}]$. The resulting row-echelon form allows us to identify pivot variables and free variables. By expressing the pivot variables in terms of the free variables, we can write the general solution vector $\vec{x}$ as a linear combination of vectors. These vectors that form the linear combination are the **basis vectors** for the Null Space. For example, consider matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 2 & 4 & 6 \end{pmatrix}$. We solve $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$:
    $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 2 & 4 & 6 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
    Row reducing: $R_2 \to R_2 - 2R_1$ gives $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
    Here, $x_1$ is a pivot variable, and $x_2, x_3$ are free variables.
    From $x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = 0$, we get $x_1 = -2x_2 - 3x_3$.
    So, $\vec{x} = \begin{pmatrix} -2x_2 - 3x_3 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{pmatrix} = x_2 \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + x_3 \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.
    A basis for $N(A)$ is $\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \right\}$.

3.  **Explain the properties of Hermitian symmetric matrices with respect to their eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Why are these properties significant in various applications, such as quantum mechanics or data analysis?**
    **Hermitian symmetric matrices** (or simply symmetric matrices in the case of real entries) possess two remarkably important properties concerning their **eigenvalues** and **eigenvectors**. Firstly, all **eigenvalues of a Hermitian symmetric matrix are real numbers**. This is significant because eigenvalues often represent physically observable quantities (like energy levels in quantum mechanics, or variances in data analysis). Ensuring they are real means these quantities correspond to actual, measurable values in the real world. Secondly, **eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues of a Hermitian symmetric matrix are orthogonal to each other**. This property is incredibly powerful as it implies that these eigenvectors form an orthogonal basis for the vector space.
    In **quantum mechanics**, operators representing observable physical quantities are Hermitian. Their real eigenvalues correspond to the possible outcomes of measurements, and their orthogonal eigenvectors form a complete set of basis states. In **data analysis**, symmetric matrices appear as covariance matrices. Their eigenvalues represent the variance along principal components (eigenvectors), and the orthogonality of eigenvectors means these components are uncorrelated, allowing for effective dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). These properties make Hermitian matrices indispensable for simplifying complex systems, enabling robust analysis, and interpreting fundamental characteristics in diverse scientific and engineering disciplines.

4.  **Describe the steps involved in Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD) for a Hermitian symmetric matrix. Explain the role of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues in this decomposition and its utility in simplifying matrix operations or understanding matrix behavior.**
    **Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD)** for a **Hermitian symmetric matrix** $A$ is a factorization that expresses $A$ in terms of its fundamental scaling factors and directions. The steps typically involve:
    1.  **Find the Eigenvalues ($\Lambda$):** Solve the characteristic equation $\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0$ for $\lambda$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. The solutions are the eigenvalues. For a Hermitian matrix, these $\lambda$ values will be real.
    2.  **Find the Eigenvectors ($V$):** For each eigenvalue $\lambda$, solve the linear system $(A - \lambda I)\vec{x} = \vec{0}$ to find the corresponding eigenvectors $\vec{x}$.
    3.  **Normalize Eigenvectors (Optional but common for EVD):** Normalize each eigenvector to have a **unit norm** ($||\vec{x}|| = 1$). If eigenvectors correspond to distinct eigenvalues, they are already orthogonal; otherwise, apply Gram-Schmidt if necessary for repeated eigenvalues.
    4.  **Form Matrices $V$ and $\Lambda$:** Construct the matrix $V$ by using the orthonormal eigenvectors as its columns. Form the diagonal matrix $\Lambda$ with the eigenvalues on its main diagonal, corresponding to the order of eigenvectors in $V$.
    The EVD is then expressed as $A = V\Lambda V^*$, where $V^*$ is the conjugate transpose of $V$ (for real symmetric matrices, $V^*=V^T$).
    * **Role of Eigenvectors ($V$):** The columns of $V$ are the eigenvectors, which define the **principal directions** or invariant axes of the linear transformation represented by $A$. They form an orthonormal basis, meaning they are mutually perpendicular and unit length.
    * **Role of Eigenvalues ($\Lambda$):** The diagonal elements of $\Lambda$ are the eigenvalues, which represent the **scaling factors** or "strengths" of the transformation along each corresponding eigenvector direction.
    **Utility:** EVD is immensely useful. It **simplifies matrix operations**; for instance, $A^k = V\Lambda^k V^*$, making powers of matrices easy to compute. It allows for a deep **understanding of matrix behavior**, revealing how a transformation stretches, shrinks, or rotates vectors along specific directions. In applications like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), EVD of the covariance matrix reveals the directions of maximum variance (principal components) in data, facilitating dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.

5.  **Compare and contrast the concepts of "norm," "unit norm," and "orthogonality" in vector spaces. How are these concepts interconnected, and why are they fundamental to understanding vector geometry and transformations?**
    **Norm**, **unit norm**, and **orthogonality** are interconnected concepts that are foundational to vector geometry and linear transformations.
    * The **norm** of a vector ($||\vec{v}||$) is its length or magnitude, a non-negative scalar quantifying its "size." For a vector $\vec{v} = (v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n)$, its Euclidean norm is $||\vec{v}|| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \ldots + v_n^2}$.
    * A **unit norm** vector (or **unit vector**) is simply a vector whose norm is exactly $1$. It represents a pure direction without any associated magnitude. Any non-zero vector can be normalized to a unit vector by dividing it by its norm ($\hat{u} = \vec{v} / ||\vec{v}||$).
    * **Orthogonality** describes the relationship between two vectors where they are perpendicular to each other. Mathematically, two vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ are orthogonal if their **dot product** is zero ($\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = 0$).

    These concepts are interconnected:
    * Unit norm vectors are derived from the concept of a norm.
    * Orthogonality, when combined with unit norm, defines **orthonormality**, a powerful property for basis vectors (e.g., in Cartesian coordinates, the standard basis vectors $\hat{i}, \hat{j}, \hat{k}$ are orthonormal).
    * Orthogonal vectors allow for easy decomposition of other vectors into components that are independent of each other (using projections).

    They are fundamental because they provide the geometric bedrock for understanding vector spaces and linear transformations:
    * **Norm** allows us to measure distances and sizes, crucial for error analysis, optimization, and defining convergence.
    * **Unit norm** vectors simplify direction-related calculations and form standard bases, making vector representations consistent.
    * **Orthogonality** is key to decoupling effects in multi-dimensional systems. It simplifies coordinate transformations, enables efficient data representation (e.g., in signal processing or image compression through orthogonal transforms), and is critical in understanding the properties of matrices (like Hermitian matrices whose eigenvectors are orthogonal). Together, they allow us to describe the geometry of vector spaces, measure relationships between vectors, and interpret how linear transformations act on these vectors in terms of stretching, shrinking, and rotation.
