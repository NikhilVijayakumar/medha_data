# Solution

Here's the solution to the problem, broken down into the requested parts:

We are given a sample of $n=10$ days of sales data, $X_i \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2=4)$, which means the standard deviation is $\sigma = \sqrt{4} = 2$.
The observed sales data is:
$X = \{5.2, 4.8, 5.4, 4.9, 5.1, 5.0, 4.7, 5.3, 5.0, 4.9\}$.

### 1. Compute the sample mean $\overline{X}$, which serves as an estimate of the average daily sales ($\mu$).

The sample mean $\overline{X}$ is calculated as the sum of all observations divided by the number of observations:
$\overline{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$

Let's sum the observed sales data:
Sum $= 5.2 + 4.8 + 5.4 + 4.9 + 5.1 + 5.0 + 4.7 + 5.3 + 5.0 + 4.9 = 50.3$

Now, compute the sample mean:
$\overline{X} = \frac{50.3}{10} = \mathbf{5.03}$

### 2. Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of $\overline{X}$ as an estimator of $\mu$.

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) of an estimator $\hat{\theta}$ for a parameter $\theta$ is defined as $MSE(\hat{\theta}) = E[(\hat{\theta} - \theta)^2]$.
For the sample mean $\overline{X}$ as an estimator of $\mu$, the MSE is given by:
$MSE(\overline{X}) = Var(\overline{X}) + (Bias(\overline{X}))^2$

First, let's find the bias of $\overline{X}$:
$Bias(\overline{X}) = E[\overline{X}] - \mu$
Since $E[X_i] = \mu$,
$E[\overline{X}] = E\left[\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\right] = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i] = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mu = \frac{n\mu}{n} = \mu$
So, $Bias(\overline{X}) = \mu - \mu = 0$.
This means $\overline{X}$ is an **unbiased estimator** of $\mu$.

Now, let's find the variance of $\overline{X}$:
$Var(\overline{X}) = Var\left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\right)$
Since the $X_i$ are i.i.d., $Var(\sum X_i) = \sum Var(X_i)$.
$Var(\overline{X}) = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} Var(X_i)$
Given $Var(X_i) = \sigma^2 = 4$,
$Var(\overline{X}) = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n^2} (n \sigma^2) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$

Substitute the given values: $n=10$ and $\sigma^2=4$.
$Var(\overline{X}) = \frac{4}{10} = 0.4$

Finally, calculate the MSE:
$MSE(\overline{X}) = Var(\overline{X}) + (Bias(\overline{X}))^2$
$MSE(\overline{X}) = 0.4 + (0)^2 = \mathbf{0.4}$

### 3. Explain why $\overline{X}$ is a consistent estimator of $\mu$.

An estimator $\hat{\theta}_n$ (based on a sample size $n$) is said to be a **consistent estimator** of a parameter $\theta$ if it converges in probability to $\theta$ as the sample size $n$ approaches infinity. Mathematically, this means:
$\lim_{n \to \infty} P(|\hat{\theta}_n - \theta| > \epsilon) = 0$ for any $\epsilon > 0$.

A sufficient condition for consistency is that the estimator is unbiased and its variance approaches zero as $n \to \infty$.

From Part 2, we know that:
1.  **$\overline{X}$ is an unbiased estimator of $\mu$**: $E[\overline{X}] = \mu$. This means $Bias(\overline{X}) = 0$.
2.  **The variance of $\overline{X}$ goes to zero as $n \to \infty$**: $Var(\overline{X}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$.
    As $n \to \infty$, $Var(\overline{X}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n} \to 0$.

Since $\overline{X}$ is unbiased and its variance tends to zero as the sample size increases, $\overline{X}$ is a **consistent estimator** of $\mu$. This implies that as we collect more and more sales data, our sample mean will get arbitrarily close to the true average daily sales $\mu$.

### 4. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the average daily sales ($\mu$) using the sample data.

Since the population standard deviation ($\sigma=2$) is known and the sample size $n=10$ is relatively small, we use the Z-distribution to construct the confidence interval for the mean. The formula for a confidence interval for $\mu$ when $\sigma$ is known is:
$\overline{X} \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

For a 95% confidence interval, $\alpha = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$. So, $\alpha/2 = 0.025$.
We need to find the Z-score $Z_{0.025}$. This is the value such that the area to its right in the standard normal distribution is 0.025. Equivalently, the area to its left is $1 - 0.025 = 0.975$.
From a standard normal (Z-score) table or calculator, $Z_{0.025} = 1.96$.

Now, plug in the values:
$\overline{X} = 5.03$
$\sigma = 2$
$n = 10$
$Z_{\alpha/2} = 1.96$

The margin of error (ME) is:
$ME = Z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = 1.96 \times \frac{2}{\sqrt{10}}$
$ME = 1.96 \times \frac{2}{3.162}$
$ME = 1.96 \times 0.6325$
$ME \approx 1.2397$

Now, construct the confidence interval:
Confidence Interval $= \overline{X} \pm ME$
Confidence Interval $= 5.03 \pm 1.2397$

Lower bound $= 5.03 - 1.2397 = 3.7903$
Upper bound $= 5.03 + 1.2397 = 6.2697$

Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for the average daily sales ($\mu$) is $\mathbf{(3.7903, 6.2697)}$.
