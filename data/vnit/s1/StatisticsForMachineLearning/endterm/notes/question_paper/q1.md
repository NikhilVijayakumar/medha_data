# **Q1.** 
> A company runs two independent recommendation systems to suggest movies to users.[4, 5] The first system ($S_1$) suggests action movies, while the second system ($S_2$) suggests comedies. Each system tracks whether a user engages with its recommendations (e.g., watches a recommended movie).[6] The engagement probability for $S_1$ is $p_1 = 0.6$ and for $S_2$ is $p_2 = 0.7$.[7] Over the course of a day:
    * $S_1$ makes $n_1 = 4$ recommendations to a user.
    * $S_2$ makes $n_2 = 3$ recommendations to the same user.

> Let X denote the number of engagements with $S_1$ recommendations and Y denote the number of engagements with $S_2$ recommendations.

 
> 1. What is the joint probability $P(X=2, Y=1)$, representing the likelihood that the user engages with 2 recommendations from $S_1$ and 1 from $S_2$?
 
> 2. Compute the expected number of engagements $E[X]$ and $E[Y]$ for $S_1$ and $S_2$.

> 3. Determine whether the number of engagements with $S_1$ and $S_2$ recommendations (X and Y) are independent.
 
> 4. If the total user engagement across both systems is $Z=X+Y$, what are the expected total engagements $E[Z]$ and the variance Var(Z)?

# Solution

**Given:**
* Engagement probability for $S_1$, $p_1 = 0.6$
* Engagement probability for $S_2$, $p_2 = 0.7$
* Number of recommendations from $S_1$, $n_1 = 4$
* Number of recommendations from $S_2$, $n_2 = 3$

Let $X$ be the number of engagements with $S_1$ recommendations and $Y$ be the number of engagements with $S_2$ recommendations. Both $X$ and $Y$ follow a **binomial distribution** since they represent the number of successes (engagements) in a fixed number of trials (recommendations).

* For $S_1$: $X \sim B(n_1=4, p_1=0.6)$
* For $S_2$: $Y \sim B(n_2=3, p_2=0.7)$

The probability mass function (PMF) for a binomial distribution is given by:
$P(k; n, p) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^{(n-k)}$
where $C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$

### 1. Joint Probability $P(X=2, Y=1)$

Since the two recommendation systems are independent, the number of engagements $X$ and $Y$ are also independent. Therefore, the joint probability is the product of their individual probabilities:

$P(X=2, Y=1) = P(X=2) * P(Y=1)$

#### Calculating $P(X=2)$:
$P(X=2) = C(4, 2) * (0.6)^2 * (1-0.6)^{(4-2)}$
$P(X=2) = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} * (0.6)^2 * (0.4)^2$
$P(X=2) = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} * 0.36 * 0.16$
$P(X=2) = 6 * 0.36 * 0.16 = \mathbf{0.3456}$

#### Calculating $P(Y=1)$:
$P(Y=1) = C(3, 1) * (0.7)^1 * (1-0.7)^{(3-1)}$
$P(Y=1) = \frac{3!}{1!(3-1)!} * (0.7)^1 * (0.3)^2$
$P(Y=1) = 3 * 0.7 * 0.09$
$P(Y=1) = \mathbf{0.189}$

#### Calculating the Joint Probability:
$P(X=2, Y=1) = 0.3456 * 0.189 = \mathbf{0.0652224}$

### 2. Expected Number of Engagements $E[X]$ and $E[Y]$

For a binomial distribution $B(n, p)$, the **expected value** is $E = n * p$.

#### For $E[X]$ (engagements with $S_1$):
$E[X] = n_1 * p_1 = 4 * 0.6 = \mathbf{2.4}$

#### For $E[Y]$ (engagements with $S_2$):
$E[Y] = n_2 * p_2 = 3 * 0.7 = \mathbf{2.1}$

### 3. Independence of X and Y

The problem statement explicitly mentions that the two recommendation systems ($S_1$ and $S_2$) are **independent**. Since $X$ and $Y$ represent the outcomes (number of engagements) from these independent systems, the number of engagements with $S_1$ recommendations ($X$) and $S_2$ recommendations ($Y$) **are indeed independent**. This independence was crucial for calculating the joint probability in Part 1.

### 4. Expected Total Engagements $E[Z]$ and Variance $Var(Z)$ for $Z=X+Y$

#### Expected Total Engagements $E[Z]$:
The **linearity of expectation** states that $E[X+Y] = E[X] + E[Y]$, regardless of whether $X$ and $Y$ are independent.

$E[Z] = E[X] + E[Y] = 2.4 + 2.1 = \mathbf{4.5}$

#### Variance $Var(Z)$:
Since $X$ and $Y$ are independent, the **variance of their sum is the sum of their individual variances**: $Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y)$.

For a binomial distribution $B(n, p)$, the **variance** is $Var = n * p * (1-p)$.

##### Calculating $Var(X)$:
$Var(X) = n_1 * p_1 * (1-p_1) = 4 * 0.6 * (1-0.6) = 4 * 0.6 * 0.4 = \mathbf{0.96}$

##### Calculating $Var(Y)$:
$Var(Y) = n_2 * p_2 * (1-p_2) = 3 * 0.7 * (1-0.7) = 3 * 0.7 * 0.3 = \mathbf{0.63}$

##### Calculating $Var(Z)$:
$Var(Z) = Var(X) + Var(Y) = 0.96 + 0.63 = \mathbf{1.59}$
