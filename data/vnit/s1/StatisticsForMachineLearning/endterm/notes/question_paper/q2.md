# Solution

To determine the stationarity, compute the mean and autocovariance function of the process $X_t$. The power spectral density (PSD) can then be derived from the autocovariance function, especially considering the independent nature of the noise.

Here's the solution to the problem:

Let's analyze the given sales data model:
$X_t = 10 + Y_t + N_t$
where:
* Baseline average daily sales: 10
* Seasonality component: $Y_t = 3 \cos(2\pi f_0 t)$ with frequency $f_0 = \frac{1}{7}$
* Noise component: $\{N_t\}$ is i.i.d. Gaussian noise with $E[N_t] = 0$ and $Var(N_t) = \sigma^2 = 2$.
    Since $N_t$ is i.i.d., its autocovariance is $C_N(k) = E[N_t N_{t+k}] - E[N_t]E[N_{t+k}] = Var(N_t) \delta(k) = \sigma^2 \delta(k)$.

### 1. Is the process $\{X_t\}$ stationary in the strict or wide-sense?

For a process to be **strictly stationary**, its joint probability distribution must remain unchanged when shifted in time. For **wide-sense stationarity (WSS)**, the following conditions must be met:
1.  The mean $E[X_t]$ is constant for all $t$.
2.  The autocovariance function $C_X(t, t+k)$ depends only on the lag $k$, not on $t$.

Let's compute the mean of $X_t$:
$E[X_t] = E[10 + Y_t + N_t]$
$E[X_t] = E[10] + E[Y_t] + E[N_t]$
$E[X_t] = 10 + E[3 \cos(2\pi f_0 t)] + 0$
$E[X_t] = 10 + 3 \cos(2\pi f_0 t)$

Since $E[X_t]$ depends on $t$ due to the cosine term, the mean is not constant.
Therefore, the process $\{X_t\}$ is **not wide-sense stationary**, and consequently, it is **not strictly stationary**. The seasonality component $Y_t$ makes the process non-stationary.

### 2. Compute the mean and autocovariance function of $\{X_t\}$.

#### Mean Function:
As derived above:
$E[X_t] = 10 + 3 \cos(2\pi f_0 t)$

#### Autocovariance Function:
The autocovariance function is defined as $C_X(t, t+k) = E[(X_t - E[X_t])(X_{t+k} - E[X_{t+k}])]$.
Let's first find $X_t - E[X_t]$:
$X_t - E[X_t] = (10 + Y_t + N_t) - (10 + E[Y_t])$
$X_t - E[X_t] = Y_t - E[Y_t] + N_t$
Since $Y_t = 3 \cos(2\pi f_0 t)$, $E[Y_t] = 3 \cos(2\pi f_0 t)$. So, $Y_t - E[Y_t] = 0$. This is a deterministic signal, not a random variable.
Therefore, $X_t - E[X_t] = N_t$. This is an important simplification due to $Y_t$ being deterministic.

Now, let's compute $C_X(t, t+k)$:
$C_X(t, t+k) = E[(N_t)(N_{t+k})]$
Since $N_t$ is i.i.d. with mean 0, $E[N_t N_{t+k}] = E[N_t]E[N_{t+k}]$ for $k \ne 0$ and $E[N_t^2]$ for $k=0$.
More generally, the autocovariance of $N_t$ is:
$C_N(k) = E[N_t N_{t+k}] - E[N_t]E[N_{t+k}] = E[N_t N_{t+k}]$ (since $E[N_t]=0$)
We know that for i.i.d. noise, $C_N(k) = \sigma^2 \delta(k)$, where $\delta(k)$ is the Kronecker delta function.
So, $C_X(t, t+k) = \sigma^2 \delta(k) = 2 \delta(k)$.

**Note:** This result implies that the *random* part of $X_t$ (which is $N_t$) is WSS. However, the overall process $X_t$ is not WSS due to the time-varying mean.

### 3. What do you mean by the Power Spectral Density (PSD)? If the noise sequence $N_t$ is i.i.d. and independent of $Y_t$, compute the PSD of $\{X_t\}$.

#### Power Spectral Density (PSD):
The Power Spectral Density (PSD) of a wide-sense stationary (WSS) random process describes how the power of a signal is distributed over different frequencies. It is the Fourier Transform of the autocovariance function of the process. For a discrete-time WSS process with autocovariance function $C_X(k)$, the PSD $S_X(f)$ is given by:
$S_X(f) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} C_X(k) e^{-j2\pi fk}$
The PSD provides insights into the frequency content of the signal. Peaks in the PSD indicate dominant frequencies in the signal's random fluctuations.

#### Computing the PSD of $\{X_t\}$:
For a process that is not WSS, the concept of a single PSD for the entire process is not straightforward as the time-varying mean introduces spectral content at the frequency of the deterministic component. However, we can analyze the PSD of the *random component* and the spectral content of the deterministic component separately.

Let $X_t = \mu_X(t) + Z_t$, where $\mu_X(t) = 10 + Y_t$ is the deterministic mean and $Z_t = N_t$ is the zero-mean random component.
The PSD typically refers to the spectral distribution of the random fluctuations around the mean.

The PSD of the noise $N_t$:
Since $N_t$ is i.i.d. with $E[N_t] = 0$ and $Var(N_t) = \sigma^2 = 2$, its autocovariance function is $C_N(k) = \sigma^2 \delta(k)$.
The PSD of $N_t$ is:
$S_N(f) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} C_N(k) e^{-j2\pi fk}$
$S_N(f) = C_N(0) e^{-j2\pi f(0)} + \sum_{k \ne 0} C_N(k) e^{-j2\pi fk}$
$S_N(f) = \sigma^2 \cdot 1 + 0 = \sigma^2 = 2$
So, the PSD of the noise is constant across all frequencies, indicating **white noise**.

Now, let's consider the deterministic component $Y_t = 3 \cos(2\pi f_0 t)$.
A deterministic signal like $A \cos(2\pi f_0 t)$ has spectral content at the frequency $f_0$. Its power spectrum (which is related to PSD for deterministic signals) will have impulses (Dirac delta functions) at $\pm f_0$.
The Fourier Transform of $A \cos(2\pi f_0 t)$ is $\frac{A}{2} [\delta(f - f_0) + \delta(f + f_0)]$.
For power, we consider the magnitude squared.

Given $X_t = 10 + 3 \cos(2\pi f_0 t) + N_t$, and $N_t$ is independent of the deterministic part:
The PSD of $X_t$ can be considered as the sum of the spectral content from the deterministic part and the PSD of the random part.
The constant term 10 corresponds to a DC component, which manifests as an impulse at $f=0$ in the spectrum.
The term $3 \cos(2\pi f_0 t)$ corresponds to impulses at $f = \pm f_0$.
The noise term $N_t$ contributes a flat PSD of $\sigma^2$.

Therefore, the PSD of $\{X_t\}$ will have contributions from both the deterministic and stochastic parts.
The PSD, $S_X(f)$, will consist of:
1.  A Dirac delta function at $f=0$ due to the constant term 10. The power associated with this component is $10^2 = 100$.
2.  Two Dirac delta functions at $f = \pm f_0 = \pm \frac{1}{7}$ due to the sinusoidal component. The power associated with these components is $(\frac{3}{2})^2 = \frac{9}{4}$ at each frequency.
3.  A constant PSD of $\sigma^2 = 2$ due to the i.i.d. Gaussian noise.

So, the PSD of $\{X_t\}$ can be expressed as:
$S_X(f) = 100 \delta(f) + \frac{9}{4} \delta(f - f_0) + \frac{9}{4} \delta(f + f_0) + \sigma^2$
$S_X(f) = 100 \delta(f) + \frac{9}{4} \delta(f - \frac{1}{7}) + \frac{9}{4} \delta(f + \frac{1}{7}) + 2$

This representation captures the spectral content of the entire process, including both its deterministic and random components.
